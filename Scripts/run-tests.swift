//
// `swift test` builds the bundle correctly on a machine with Command Line
// Tools and no Xcode, but the helper that would execute it exits silently
// without running anything — a deliberately failing assertion still reports
// success, which is worse than having no tests at all.
//
// So the bundle is loaded and Swift Testing's own entry point is called
// directly. `Scripts/test.sh` builds and then runs this. On a machine with
// Xcode, and in CI, plain `swift test` works and this is not needed.
