# Creates the stable local code-signing identity from §67, tier 2.
#
# Why this exists: an ad-hoc signature is different on every build, so macOS
# treats each rebuild as a *different application* and drops the Launch at
# Login registration (§34) along with anything else keyed to the app's
# identity. A constant identity — self-signed is fine — gives every local build
# the same designated requirement, so that state survives rebuilding.
#
# It is not a substitute for notarization: a build signed this way still shows
# Gatekeeper's "unverified developer" prompt if someone downloads it.
#
# Offline, free, no Apple account, and idempotent — run it as many times as you
# like.
